# 📧 AI-Powered Communication Assistant

Modern organizations receive hundreds (sometimes thousands) of emails daily. Many of these emails are support-related (e.g., customer queries, requests, or help tickets). Manually sifting through these emails, prioritizing them, and drafting professional responses can be time-consuming and error-prone.

The **AI-Powered Communication Assistant** is an end-to-end intelligent email management solution that automates the entire workflow — from retrieving incoming emails, categorizing & prioritizing them, generating contextual responses, and displaying insights on a user-friendly dashboard.
